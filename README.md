The content in this repository was created for Harvard Extension School DGMD S-14 - Wearable Devices and Computer Vision.

The document "Final Report" provides the detail on all of the work performed for this project.

Software created for the ST SensorTile board was developed by STMicroelectronics and was modified for the use for this project. To deploy on a new board, 
flash the binary located in the folder "use these binaries" or build the project and flash. For more information, use the tutorials found on the UCLA
STMicroelectronics SensorTile Internet of Things Curriculum found at https://sites.google.com/view/ucla-stmicroelectronics-iot/home?authuser=0.

An R notebook is also provided for performing data smoothing, cleaning, and segmentation. Some modifications will need to be performed by the user
to ensure file names and paths are correct. All data used is located in the Data/raw data directory.

Data then can be uploaded to EdgeImpulse or the project can be cloned from here: https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/public/43059/latest.
